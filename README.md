# Axioms of separation
This is a LEAN repository that collects the lemmas and theorems presented in a seminar, given as part of the topology course of Professor Natalia Castellana ``@natacast``
at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, and propose those statements in LEAN code.  You will find two files: one has the statements as exercises and the 
other has their respective solutions.
